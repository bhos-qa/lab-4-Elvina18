### 1. **Statement Coverage**
During testing, statement coverage guarantees that each line of code is executed at least once. Its purposeÂ is to verify that every line of code is tested, which helps identify the parts of the code that haven't been run.

### 2. **Branch Coverage**
Branch coverage evaluates if decision points such as `if` and `switch` are used to execute all feasible branches (true/false results). This guarantees that each logical branch in the code is examined for any deviations in results.

### 3. **Predicate Coverage**
The goal of predicate coverage is to evaluate each condition in complex boolean statements to see if it is true or false. To detect logical flaws, it makes sure that each possible combination of boolean variables is assessed.
